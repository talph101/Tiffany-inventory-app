## StockSync Inventory App

An eCommerce store where internal users can directly view and manage products without any intermediary service over the internet. The goal was to develop an easy to use web-based interface where users can search for products, and view a complete description of the product. Since the store is meant for internal use only, users are allowed to add, update and delete items.
